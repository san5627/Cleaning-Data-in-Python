Cleaning Data : 
1. Prepare Data for Analysis
2. Data almost never comes in clean
3. Diagnose data for problems

Common Data problems :
1. Inconsistent column names
2. Missing Data
3. Outliers
4. Duplicated rows
5. Untidy
6. Need to process columms
7. Columns types can signal unexpected data values

Exploratory Data Analysis : 
1. Frequency Counts - Count the number of unique values in the data.
2. Summary Statistics
2.1. Numeric columns (describe() which return only numeric values)
2.2. Outliers - Considerably higher or lower, require further investigations

Visual EDA : 
- Great way to spot outliers and obvious errors
- More than just looking for patterns
- Plan data cleaning steps

Bar plots and histograms :
- Bar plots for discrete columns counts
- Histogram for continuous data counts
- Look at frequencies

Box plot : Visual basic summary statistics
- Outliers
- Min / Max
- 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles

Scatter plot :
- Relationship between 2 numeric variables
- Flag potentially bad data which we cannot look by looking at 1 variables
